## To-Do List
- [ ] **Add STLs** (3D print files for the enclosure)
- [ ] **Create Circuit Diagram** (showing the ESP32, 2222A transistors, and LiPo setup)
- [ ] **Parts List** (BOM: ESP32, buzzers, diodes, resistors, etc.)
- [ ] **Pictures** (Photos of the finished protoboard and the "Boiler Up" branding)
- [ ] **Default Configuration** (Move default configuration to a config file)
- [ ] **Fix Wait During Timer** (Timer stops during 600ms whistle, needs async)
- [ ] **PCB Design** (?)
- [ ] **Audio Output** (Headphone jack to connect speaker, jack switch to disable piezo)
- [ ] **Status LEDs** (Charging, on/off, etc) 
- [ ] **Battery Level** (Read through voltage divider and ADC)
- [ ] **Battery Optimization** (Sleep wifi, drop ESP32 frequency to 80MHz)
- [ ] **Clean Github** (Reduce bloat, provide build instructions)

why am I doing this, a mobile app would work fine
